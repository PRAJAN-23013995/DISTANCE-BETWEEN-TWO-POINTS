# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Import the math library to use sqrt() function.
### Step 2: Create the list with the given coordinates.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: Display the distance between two points.
### Step 5: End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
list1=[4,2]
list2=[10,6]
d=math.sqrt((list2[0]-list1[0])**2+(list2[1]-list1[1])**2)
print(f"{d:.2f}") 
```
